Implement a HTTP server with support for persistent connections. The server should be 
capable of serving the following three files (make up your own files):
a. a.jpg 
b. b.mp3
c. c.txt.
Next, implement two HTTP client programs which request the three files sequentially (one 
after the another). The first client is supposed to use HTTP persistent connections and the 
second one should use non-persistent HTTP connections (the request for every item 
creates a new transport layer connection). For both the clients, compare and report the 
retrieval time for all the items individually.
