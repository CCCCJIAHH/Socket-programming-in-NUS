I will talk the way to run on Ubuntu.
	1) open the file using "cd"
 	2) run the server using " Python3 server.py" 
 	3) run the client using " Python3 persistent_client.py" or "Python3 non_persistent_client.py" depending on wich client you want to use

Important tips: 
 	1) make sure that you run the server first. If you first run the client, there will be no connection.
 	2) make sure after you run the server, run the client in 15 seconds for I set a timeout of 15 seconds. If there is no conenction established, the server will be closed. 
	 3) make sure that there are a.jpg, b.mp3 and c.txt in the same folder with server and clients.
 	4) when the server shows "the channel or net is already been used", just type left-control+c to clear the memory.
